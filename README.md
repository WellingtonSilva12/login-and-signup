# Login and Signup - Sass and Javascript

Login and signup screen, mobile type, using the concepts already acquired during my studies. In this project, my biggest challenge was developing the screen transition logic and adding the action button that shows the user's password, both of which I used javascript.
This was my second contact with the css preprocessor, Sass. It makes our css much more understandable and easy to maintain the code.

## Technologies used
HTML, SASS e Javascript
